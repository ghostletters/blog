### Updating the Server

After almost 3 years - and with Ubuntu 24.04 around the corner - I thought it is about time to take care of my server updates. The following updates where executed:

- Ubuntu from 20.04 to 22.04 (last LTS to current LTS)
- update NodeJS 14 (ðŸ˜±) to NodeJS 21. I cannot remember why I even installed node in the first place. But might be handy if I ever come back to use [VitePress](https://vitepress.dev)
- update Go 1.14.2 to 1.22.0 (latest)
-- maybe I switch to the apt version after the upgrade to 24.04
- upgrade xcaddy with the exec module from 2.3.0 to 2.7.6
-- had to modify the caddy config file slightly. Statements like `log { }` require now a line break between opening and closing bracket.

All in all it went prett smooth and took maybe around 1 hour, where a good part was waiting for Ubuntu to install new packages.
