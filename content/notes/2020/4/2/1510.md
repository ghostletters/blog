### GitHub Actions are Fun...

... but it can be a bit slow sometimes. Lately, I experienced total build times of ~10 mins for my very simple blog. This is annoying when I want to fix a small typo (which happens quite often). Even on a good day the build on GitHub takes ~1 min. In contrast, on my local machine a new post is build in less than 1 sec. How is this possible?

### GitHub Actions Start from Scratch

GitHub Actions always start on a green field. One every execution, it fetches a more or less empty Ubuntu image. Then Hugo must be installed (as snap) on this fresh Ubuntu instance. Afterwards, Hugo translates **all** files into static HTML pages. Finally, the files are `rsync`ed to my server. While the last step is very fast, all other steps take several seconds. These seconds add up to roughly a minute. When GitHub is busy serving other customers, it becomes even slower.

### Local Builds are Incremental

When I run `hugo` locally, the first run takes several seconds. On each following execution Hugo will just translate new posts (normally just one post). All old files remain untouched. So a local run is much cheaper on resources and therefore much faster. Usually I see build times around 100 **milliseconds**.

### Build on the Edge

So far my webserver was very dumb. It just served HTML/CSS/JS files, but had no idea how these files are shipped to the server. They just magically appeared. I spent half a day to smarten up my server and the overall flow now looks like this

- write new post
- push to github
- github executes a webhook on each push
  - a 'webhook' is a fancy term for a simple HTTP `POST` request to a given URL
- the webhook destination triggers a bash script on my server. The script runs
  -  `git clone` on my blog repo on github
  -  `hugo --destination=/my/public/webserver/folder`
  -  `touch blog_refreshed.txt` writes an empty file, so the file update date is equal to the latest blog refresh

With this new setup my blog updates happen instantly (more or less). I will publish another post detailing the setup soon.

Stay tuned, ladies and gentlemen.
